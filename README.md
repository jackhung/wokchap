# Chapless Brunch 0.11.0
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/jupl/chapless-brunch.png)](https://gemnasium.com/jupl/chapless-brunch)


## Introduction
Chapless Brunch is a skeleton for building web applications, specifically single-page applications. It is a modification of [Brunch with Chaplin](https://github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin). This skeleton leverages [node](http://nodejs.org), [Brunch](http://brunch.io), [Scaffolt](https://github.com/paulmillr/scaffolt), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake) to provide cross-platform tasks in a simple package.

For a mobile/Cordova friendly variant, check out [this skeleton](https://github.com/jupl/chapless-brunch/tree/cordova).

## Requirements
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Jake](https://github.com/mde/jake#installing-with-npm) (required for development)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) (if using server extras)


## Setup
1. Install node.js.
2. If using Windows and leveraging Bower, install [Git](http://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. If working on development, install Jake.
4. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
5. Execute the command `npm install` to install all package dependencies.
6. If server is not going to just serve static assets, run the `add:serverextras` task.


## Notes

### `npm start` / `npm test`
One-line commands are provided for convenience as well for those that want to start running things as quickly as possible by installing depedencies automatically. Use `npm start` to download non-development packages and run the `server:prod` task. Use `npm test` to download all packages and run the `test:all` task.

### Server
Out of the box the server provided simply serves static assets with support for HTML5 push state. Extensible server extras can be added to support models and sessions with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), authentication with [Passport](http://passportjs.org/), and caching with [Prerender](https://prerender.io/). To add extras, see the `add:serverextras` task.


## Task List
While Brunch/Scaffolt/etc. can be used, Jake commands are provided for a simple and consistent interface. These tasks can be executed using `jake`. (`jake [task]`) These are the following available tasks provided out of the box:


### NPM

#### `npm:clean`
Remove downloaded Node modules. This is useful if you want to reinstall dependencies. (ex. updated/corrupted package(s)) Remember that you need to call `npm install` to install dependencies.


### Bower

#### `bower:install`
Download and preinstall any Bower dependencies in advance. You can run this if you want to download Bower dependencies in advance.

#### `bower:clean`
Remove downloaded Bower dependencies. This is useful if you want to reinstall dependencies. (ex. updated/corrupted package(s))


### Extras
These commands add additional features/items to the project that are not included by default.

#### `add:testing` / `rem:testing`
Add/remove packages require to run code and site testing.

#### `add:serverextras` / `rem:serverextras`
Add/remove extra packages to the server so that it does more than just serve static assets. For more information see notes above.

#### `add:jquery` / `rem:jquery`
Add/remove the ubiquitous library [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to/from the project.

#### `add:normalize` / `rem:normalize`
Add/remove [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to ensure a consistent starting point in styling between different browsers.

#### `add:lodash` / `rem:lodash`
Add/remove [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/) to/from the project.

#### `add:rivets` / `rem:rivets`
Add/remove [Rivets.js](http://rivetsjs.com/) to/from the project for binding models and views. No additional configuration is needed if added. To reference a model from a view with rivets use the `model` object. To access model properties from Rivets by default use `:`. (ex: `model:name` equates to `model.get('name')`)

#### `add:exoskeleton` / `rem:exoskeleton`
Add/remove [Exoskeleton](http://exosjs.com/) to/from the project for a more lightweight Backbone. Note that this removes/restores [classic Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), jQuery, and Lo-Dash. You can use other tasks to add/remove jQuery and Lo-Dash again.

#### `add:davy` / `rem:davy`
Add/remove [Davy](https://github.com/lvivski/davy) to/from the project for simple and lightweight Promise support. Add this if you are using Exoskeleton and want support for promises.


### Scaffolding
Scaffolding commands are available in the form of `generate` and `destroy`. (syntax ex: `jake generate codetest=user`) Multiple scaffolds can be specified in a single command, as well as separating names with commas. (ex: `jake generate codetest=test1,test2 sitetest=test3`) The following aliases are also available: `g`, `gen`, `d`, `del`. (ex: `jake g codetest=user`) Unit test files are automatically generated for Chaplin items. For Chaplin views, a template and stylesheet is also provided in addition to the code file.

#### `generate` / `destroy`
List available scaffolds.

#### `generate model=[name]` / `destroy model=[name]`
Generate/destroy a Chaplin model.

#### `generate collection=[name]` / `destroy collection=[name]`
Generate/destroy a Chaplin collection. Generating a Chaplin collection will also generate its corresponding model. Specify the name in singular form, as collection will automatically be pluralized.

#### `generate view=[name]` / `destroy view=[name]`
Generate/destroy a Chaplin view.

#### `generate collectionview=[name]` / `destroy collectionview=[name]`
Generate/destroy a Chaplin collection view. Generating a Chaplin collection view will also generate the individual item view.

#### `generate controller=[name]` / `destroy controller=[name]`
Generate/destroy a [Chaplin controller](http://docs.chaplinjs.org/chaplin.controller.html).

#### `generate codetest=[name]` / `destroy codetest=[name]`
Generate/destroy a test file with the given test name for testing client-side code with Karma.

#### `generate sitetest=[name]` / `destroy sitetest=[name]`
Generate/destroy a test file with the given test name for testing the site with WebDriverJS.


### Testing
Tests leverage [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Mocha as Promised](https://github.com/domenic/mocha-as-promised), and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). Code and site testing is provided. Code testing adds [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) and [Sinon-Chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai). Testing packages will automatically be installed if not available.

#### `test:all [codereporter=[codereporter]] [sitereporter=[sitereporter]]`
Run all tests listed below once. For more information on reporters see below.

#### `test:code [reporter=[reporter]] [watch=false]`
Run code-based tests (ex. unit tests) using Karma. Karma is preconfigured to run with all available browsers on the system. ([PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) is included). Karma reporter can be specified with the `reporter` option. If you run this task with `watch=true` Karma will auto-run on file changes. Otherwise by default Karma runs once. You can also run the server while watching files with `watch=server`.

#### `test:site [reporter=[reporter]] [watch=false]`
Run site-based tests (ex. system tests) using PhantomJS and WebDriverJS. A server is started up temporarily to interact with the site. A Mocha reporter can be specified with the `reporter` option. If you run this task with `watch=true` Mocha will auto-run on file changes with [nodemon](http://remy.github.io/nodemon/). Otherwise by default Mocha runs once. The global method `getDriver` is provided to get a setup and built driver. WebDriverJS' use of Promises can be combined with Mocha as Promised to handle asynchronous behavior easily. ex:

```coffeescript
describe 'Sample', ->

  before ->
    @driver = getDriver()

  beforeEach ->
    @driver.get(baseUrl)

  it 'Has a proper title', ->
    @driver.getTitle().then (title) ->
      title.should.equal('Chapless Brunch')

  after ->
    @driver.quit()
```


### Building
These commands are used to assemble the application, generating the necessary JS/CSS and adding assets. Use `dev` mode to keep readable JS/CSS, plus include source maps. Use `prod` mode to minify/uglify JS/CSS as well as omit source maps and tests. If any Bower dependencies have not been downloaded yet, Bower will first download them.

#### `build:[mode]`
Assemble the application once.

#### `watch:[mode]`
Assemble the application and continue to watch for changes. Rebuild every time a change is detected.

#### `server:[mode]`
Assemble the application and continue to watch for changes. Rebuild every time a change is detected. Also, the application is served locally to open with a browser.
